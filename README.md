# Bunk'O'Bed
  Bunk'O'Bed connects people who have space to spare with those who are looking for a place to stay.Bunk'O'Bed design model has been inspired from existing Airbnb system. The work   includes complete object oriented design analysis through UML modelling and partial implementation of the complete system. 
  
    UML(Unified Modelling Language) is used for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems.
# Complete Documentation with implementation
  This documentation covers:
  1. Introduction to the system and its scope
  2. Identifying usecases with diagrams
  3. Domain Model
  4. Class Model
  5. System Sequence Diagrams
  6. State Model Diagram
  7. Activity Diagram
  8. Implemenation of a particular usecase
  
    All the UML modelling and diagrams have been done after identifying core functionalities and filtering them out according to their priorities. All the possible scenarios and models have not been considered for the designing.
# Implemented Code
  The implementation has been done using Java with the help of Java libraries and MySQL for database.
# Skeleton Code
  The code skeleton was generated from the class diagrams designed in StarUML. The code is in Java language.
